If this file exists, the CI process will verify the version number of vela.version and vela-parent that in pom.xml.
You must keep the version number of vela.version and vela-parent being the same as the GIMO version of Prod environments.
Otherwise the CI will fail.

You can delete this file to skip the version validation, but we strongly don't recommend you do that.
